# formtools.org website 

This is a place to report problems / make feature suggestions for the (upcoming) formtools.org website.

You'll notice there's no actual code in this repo. This will be used to house any public info like logos, etc. But mostly it's intended as a place for people to provide feedback on the site. 

### Documentation

The Form Tools documentatation is open source and found here: https://github.com/formtools/docs

Feel free to edit the docs there and submit pull requests so I can incorporate it into the site.
